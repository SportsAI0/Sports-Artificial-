# Move-to-earn

#### _Move-to-earn Sports Artificial_

_At Sports Artificial, we will adopt the "move-to-earn" concept, which is a concept that encourages people to stay active and healthy by offering financial rewards for physical activity or training. We will have an implementation through an app that tracks and monitors the user's movement, rewarding them with Sports AI tokens for each completed workout session._

#### The main benefits of "move-to-earn" include:

* [x] _Encouragement of physical activity: The financial reward can be a motivation for people to move more and maintain an exercise routine._
* [x] _Improved health: Regular physical activity can help improve physical and mental health._
* [x] _Social interaction: Our Sports Artificial "move-to-earn" app will soon allow users to share their activities with friends and family, which can increase social interaction and motivation to stay active._
* [x] _Financial innovation: "Move-to-earn" is an innovative approach to personal finance management, combining physical activity and financial rewards._

_-> The rewards of our "move-to-earn" will vary depending on various factors such as the type of physical activity performed and the duration of the workout. The rewards will be paid in Sports AI tokens._

_-> We will provide three anti-cheating methods during the use of the Sports Artificial app, where if cheating is detected, the user will be punished._

* [x] _Tracking of all activities through GPS._&#x20;
* [x] _Detection of health and movement data._&#x20;
* [x] _Explanation of machinery to detect fraud and cheating through data simulations._

_-> Any violation of the root code of the device will result in a Sports Artificial Mobile lock, causing a discrepancy in its operation._
