# NFT's Marketplace

## NFT's Marketplace - Sports Artificial

_->The integration of the metaverse with NFTs (non-fungible tokens) is a rapidly developing area. The metaverse is a virtual representation of reality, composed of immersive digital environments, usually created through virtual reality or augmented reality. NFTs, on the other hand, are unique digital tokens that represent ownership of something, whether it's a work of art, a virtual object, or any other valuable item._

_->The integration of the metaverse with our Sports AI NFTs allows users to acquire, sell, and trade their favorite athletes, creating a virtual market, our marketplace! This allows users to have true and permanent ownership of their AI Athletes, which is something new in a constantly changing digital world. Furthermore, our NFTs also allow our investors to monetize through their utilities and also through P2P negotiations as they can directly sell their unique virtual works to users._

_->Our marketplace will provide a showcase of all Sports AI items, where all investors will have access, but! In addition to the primary functions, investors will be able to mint their NFTs through our platform._

_Important addition, our collection will have 1000 NFTs, however, we will only make 30 Exclusive Launch Drops NFTs available at first! Don't miss the opportunity and get yours._
{% endhint %}

#### Mint Mechanics:

_-> Initially, we will have **30** NFTs where our investors will be able to mint within our Dapp. Our investors who acquire the Sports AI NFTs will have the right to mint them, becoming the owners of the contract and submitting their art to any NFT marketplace._

#### Future plans for the NFT marketplace - Sports AI

_We are developing an intuitive and easy-to-use game, with various sports within the platform, all very fun and of course! fully secure. Our game will have many benefits, among them the Play-to-earn mode, where we will provide our loyal players with Sports AI tokens, but for this to be possible, they will have to have the rights to our NFTs and eventually, they may also mint. Wait, as we will soon bring this exciting news._
